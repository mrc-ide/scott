Description: Simulation of transmission trees (a record of who infected whom) provided information about when and where individuals are sampled and the history of an epidemic (such as prevalence through time). This package provides functions based on structured coalescent simulation of genealogical histories so that computational complexity is independent of population size and linear in sample size.
